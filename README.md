### A Toy Model of Alternating Selection and Mutation

To further explore the impact of fluctuating selective pressures on evolutionary dynamics, we introduce a toy model simulating a haploid population subject to alternating fitness values. This model extends the study by incorporating environmental switching, allowing for a more dynamic examination of mutation-selection balance.

The model tracks four haplotypes: $AM_1$, $aM_1$, $AM_2$, and $aM_2$. Selection alternates between two fitness states every given number of generations, mimicking cyclic environmental changes. The fitness values of the alleles switch between states defined by selection coefficients $s_1$ and $s_2$. Mutation occurs between the haplotypes with rates $u_1$, $u_2$ (forward mutation) and $v_1$, $v_2$ (back mutation).
